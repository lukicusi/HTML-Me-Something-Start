               <h2>Becoming a Superhero</h2>
               <p>
                  Sometimes, you don’t need superpowers or fancy gadgets to be a superhero. <br>
                  Cosplay (also known as costume-play) is the act of dressing up for entertainment or basically any purpose you see fit. <br>
                  The level of how invested in cosplay an individual is can vary greatly. Many cosplayers use the hobby just for passive enjoyment. <br>
                  Others have found themselves deep down the road of content creation and professional costume design.

               <p>No matter your interests or skill level, cosplay is for everyone.</p>

               <h2>Picture Perfect</h2>
               <p>
                  Photography can be a big aspect of cosplay. Some cosplayers and hero/character impersonators utilize photography to get professional photos and headshots for their acting or media portfolios. <br>
                  I enjoy photography as a creative outlet and use it to document my art and experiences for both my social media pages as well as my personal memory “scrapbook”.

               <p>
                  Professional studio photography is popular for headshots and media portfolios and often gives the artists creative liberty to build their own sets for backgrounds.

                  Destination photography is my personal favorite. I’ve gotten the opportunity to do photoshoots in so many beautiful and interesting places all around the world.

                  My favorite part of cosplay is traveling for events and photography.

                  Back in 2022 I brought my Robin to Orlando, FL for their Holiday Matsuri event. <br>
                  This was the first convention I had ever flown cross-country for and it was really exciting to get to explore the area and make new friends! <br>
                  Being in Florida was amazing because the weather was super nice and we were able to do outside photoshoots even though it was the middle of December!<br>

                  Earlier this year I also got the opportunity to travel out to National Harbor, MD for Katsucon. <br>
                  Katsucon is one of the largest fandom conventions in the U.S. attracting over 20,000 attendees from all parts of the world. <br>
                  It was an amazing opportunity to get to meet with fans across the globe and share our love for cosplay.

               <h2>Working as a Superhero</h2>
               <p>
                  In the past, I’ve been hired as a costumed hero to attend meet-and-greet events. My favorite one was the Pretty Super Meet and Greet in Paducah, KY. <br>
                  They hired a few dozen cosplay professionals from all over the region to travel out and interact with the local families during their community celebration event.

               <h3>Hero work isn't always Glitz and Glam</h3>
               <p>
                  Every now and then I accept superhero volunteer opportunities to help give back to my community. <br>
                  Sometimes when local businesses are having a grand opening or having trouble with business they will call on costumed heroes for promotional work. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Other heroes I know have formed volunteer groups that schedule fundraisers and visitation events at local childrens’ hospitals to interact with the families and help boost their spirits.

                  During my journeys I've developed friendships with so many incredible individuals across the nation. <br>
                  It’s so exciting to make friends who share this kind of hobby because there’s so much opportunity to share knowledge and resources. <br>
                  Also, getting to collaborate on projects and photoshoots with artists you admire can be so rewarding!

               <h2>Getting to Meet your Heroes &#x28;Literally!&#x29;</h2>
               <p>
                  Some of the most memorable cosplay moments have been my art getting recognized by creators I've looked up to in the past. Everyone I've encountered has been so friendly and kind. <br>
                  This community is very supportive of one another and we are always sharing photography and crafting tips to help improve our art. 
               </p>
